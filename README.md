# MCP-Jailbreak-0.3 · state0

> **Phi-resonant dual-MCP stack** — two LLM-backed MCP servers, a phi-emergent routing proxy, an ERL v3 hash-chained ledger, and a tri-voice conversation system grounded in the same φ = 1.618… constant as the Analog-Prime conscious platform.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Node.js** | ≥ 18 | https://nodejs.org — required for native `fetch` and top-level `await` |
| **npm** | any | Bundled with Node.js |
| **LM Studio** | any | https://lmstudio.ai — must be running with ≥ 1 model loaded |

`launch.mjs` checks the Node version on startup and auto-runs `npm install` on first run. No other setup needed.

---

## Quick Start

**Requires Node.js ≥ 18 and npm. Nothing else.**

```powershell
# Windows — double-click start.bat, or:
node launch.mjs

# macOS / Linux:
bash start.sh
# or: chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh

# npm:
npm start
```

On first run, `launch.mjs` will automatically run `npm install` if `node_modules` is missing.

Options:
```
node launch.mjs --no-proxy              # skip coord-proxy (if LM Studio isn't running)
node launch.mjs --status                # probe all ports + list loaded LLMs
node launch.mjs --load-model MODEL_ID   # ask LM Studio to load a model (v0.3.x+ API)
node launch.mjs --help
npm run status
```

Ctrl+C (or SIGTERM) shuts down all child processes cleanly.

## ERL v3 — Hash-Chained Context Ledger

ERL (Emergent Reasoning Ledger) is a git-like hash-chained ledger stored in `erl-ledger.json`.

### Key properties

- **Phi-scored retrieval** — recency score uses `γ^k` decay (γ = 0.75, φ = 1.618 base constant)
- **Concurrent write safety** — spinlock via `erl-ledger.json.lock`
- **Merkle checkpoints** — root computed every 50 appends (`CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`)
- **Branches** — `main`, `session_context`, `twin_flame_evals`, `twin_flame_probes`, `triad_session`
- **ERL merge** — deterministic merge with conflict detection

### Internal functions (Node.js)

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `erlAppend(ledger, { branch, role, content, tags })` | Append entry; returns entry with SHA-256 id |
| `erlBranch(ledger, { name, from_branch })` | Create branch |
| `erlHistory(ledger, { branch, limit })` | Retrieve recent entries |
| `erlVerify(ledger)` | Hash-chain integrity check |
| `erlSearch(ledger, { query, branch })` | Phi-scored semantic search |
| `erlMerge(ledger, { source, target })` | Merge two branches |
| `getLedger()` | Thread-safe read with spinlock |
| `erlSave(ledger)` | Thread-safe write with spinlock |

### MCP tools (callable over SSE)

`erl_append`, `erl_history`, `erl_search`, `erl_verify`, `erl_merge`, `erl_create_branch`, `context_save`, `context_retrieve`, `erl_fold`, `erl_cleanup`

---

## MCP Tool Reference (key tools)

### `llm_query`

Direct LLM inference through LM Studio. Logs response to ERL by default.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Your question",
  "model": "qwen3.5-9b@q3_k_xl:2",
  "max_tokens": 200,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "log": true,
  "branch": "session_context"
}
```

Returns `{ response, prompt_hash, logged_to_erl, model, tokens }`.

**Timeout**: 90 000 ms. The first inference after a reboot is slow — do not lower below 90s.

**Safety rule**: Never call `llm_query` from `Promise.all` across multiple *different* model names simultaneously. LM Studio will evict the first model when the second request loads.

### `twin_flame_eval`

Log a self-evaluation for a model response. Schema is identical on both ports.

```json
{
  "confidence": 8,
  "response_summary": "brief description",
  "prompt": "original prompt",
  "model": "qwen3.5-9b@q3_k_xl:2",
  "branch": "twin_flame_evals",
  "tags": ["custom"]
}
```

Returns `{ logged, branch, entry_id, confidence }`.

### `twin_flame_probe`

Known-answer baseline + drift detection. Stores question/answer pairs and tracks hash drift over time.

### `twin_flame_divergence`

Compare the last N eval entries across both servers to measure response divergence.

### `phi_route`

Get the phi-routing decision for a prompt: `SOLO` (< 0.382), `RELAY` (0.382–0.618), or `CHALLENGE` (> 0.618).

---

## Demo Scripts

### `_twin_demo.mjs` — 2-voice stochastic divergence

Two instances of the same model answer the same question. Because sampling is non-deterministic, responses diverge even with identical weights. Measures **stochastic divergence** — how much randomness/temperature contributes to answer variance.

```powershell
node _twin_demo.mjs
```

### `_triad_demo.mjs` — 3-voice conversation

Three voices answer the same question. Responses are logged to ERL and a thematic alignment check is run.

- **Voice A** — `qwen3.5-9b@q3_k_xl:2` on port 3333
- **Voice B** — `qwen3.5-9b@q3_k_xl` on port 3334
- **Voice C** — GitHub Copilot (inline — no local endpoint needed)

```powershell
# Default run:
node _triad_demo.mjs

# Custom models (any LM Studio hot models):
node _triad_demo.mjs --modelA mistral-7b --modelB llama-3-8b

# Custom question:
node _triad_demo.mjs --question "What is the most important property of a distributed system?"

# Skip Copilot voice (2-model mode):
node _triad_demo.mjs --no-copilot

# Tune generation:
node _triad_demo.mjs --temp 0.9 --max-tokens 300
```

If a model is offline, its voice is skipped gracefully — the triad degrades to a duo without crashing.

### `_probe.mjs` — single-shot probe

Fire individual MCP tool calls for testing and inspection.

---

## Coord-Proxy — Wu-Wei Phi-Routing

`coord-proxy.js` (port 1233) sits between your client and LM Studio, routing requests based on a phi-hash of the prompt content:

| Score | Mode | Behaviour |
|-------|------|-----------|
| < 0.382 | SOLO | Forward directly to LM Studio :1234 |
| 0.382–0.618 | RELAY | Send to server A, relay result to server B for enrichment |
| > 0.618 | CHALLENGE | Send to both servers, have them evaluate each other |

```
phiScore = (sha256(prompt)[0:8] / 0xFFFFFFFF × φ) % 1
```

Distribution converges to φ-emergent proportions: **61.8% SOLO / 23.6% RELAY / 14.6% CHALLENGE**.

Check status:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:1233/status
```

## Architecture: 3 Mechanisms, Not Slop

Three multi-LLM mechanisms exist in this stack. They are not duplicates — they operate at different layers:

| Mechanism | Layer | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `_twin_demo.mjs` | Demo script | Measure stochastic variance between two samples of the same model |
| `_triad_demo.mjs` | Demo script | Explicit 3-voice conversation: 2 local LLMs + Copilot as participant |
| `coord-proxy.js` | Production routing | SOLO/RELAY/CHALLENGE phi-routing — routes traffic, not a conversation script |

The proxy is the actual production architecture. The demo scripts are measurement tools that use the same underlying transport.

---

## Phi Foundation & Analog-Prime Connection

This stack shares a mathematical foundation with the [Analog-Prime `conscious` platform](https://github.com/stealthmachines/Analog-Prime):

**PHI = 1.6180339887498948482** is the governing constant in both systems.

| This stack | Analog-Prime conscious |
|------------|----------------------|
| ERL recency decay: `γ^k`, γ = 0.75 | HDGL `Dₙ(r)` resonance: `√(φ·Fₙ·2ⁿ·Pₙ·Ω)·r^((n+1)/8)` |
| `phiHash(content) % 1` routing thresholds | Slot4096 phi-lattice bucket assignment |
| SOLO/RELAY/CHALLENGE tri-split | Markov trit gate: −1 / 0 / +1 (REJECT / UNCERTAIN / ACCEPT) |
| Three-voice triad convergence check | Kuramoto 8D oscillator phase-lock (`S(U) ≈ 1.531`) |
| ERL hash-chaining | PCR-style hash chains in PhiKernel |
| Wu-Wei routing (5 compression strategies) | Wu-Wei codec: WW_NONACTION / WW_GENTLE_STREAM / WW_BALANCED_PATH / WW_FLOWING_RIVER / WW_REPEATED_WAVES |

The **Markov trit gate** (−1/0/+1) is genuine tri-state logic — the same reason this stack avoids binary evaluations and uses 1–10 confidence scores. The three-voice triad demo is a digital analog of the Kuramoto synchronisation lock: each voice converges on an answer independently; the divergence metric measures how far apart the phases are.

## Current Hot Models

```
qwen3.5-9b@q3_k_xl:2   ← instance 2, persistent
qwen3.5-9b@q3_k_xl     ← instance 1, reload if evicted after reboot
```

Check LM Studio's **Loaded Models** tab before running any demo.

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never `Promise.all` across different model names** toward LM Studio — eviction kills one model.
2. **Never auto-discover models** with parallel probes — use confirmed names from the LM Studio UI.
3. **`llm_query` timeout is 90 000 ms** — first inference post-reboot can be slow.
4. **Port 1234 is LM Studio** — never send non-inference traffic; never restart it from code.
